    "desc": "\"Ð’inograd Bessarabii\" is a small family-run business that specializes in grape growing, located in Ukrainian Bessarabia. We grow different grape varieties, including Merlot, Odessa Black, and Isabella, which are handpicked to ensure the selection of the highest quality fruits for wine production. The grapes are then transported to a winemaking laboratory where they undergo necessary processes to produce wine. All processes executed with great attention to detail using traditional grape cultivating methods to ensure high quality and taste. Although \"Vinograd Bessarabii\" does not produce wine, we offer grape tastings and tours for visitors to experience the unique flavors of their locally grown grapes.",
